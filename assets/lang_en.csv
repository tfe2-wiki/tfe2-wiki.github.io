climate_crisis_explainer_1|Let's Stop the Climate Crisis!
climate_crisis_explainer_2|As you probably know, our climate is changing because of greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. We only have about a decade left to drastically reduce emissions if we want to prevent the worst effects, which could include flooding, droughts and major health risks. Here are just a few actions you can take:
climate_crisis_explainer_3|Vote!
climate_crisis_explainer_4|It is very important that governments create laws that help companies and people reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, please vote for a sensible party whenever you can.
climate_crisis_explainer_5|Eat Less Meat
climate_crisis_explainer_6|There are amazing meat alternatives, that taste great and cause far less harmful emissions. Also, beans or nuts can be a good alternative source of protein.
climate_crisis_explainer_7|Don't Fly
climate_crisis_explainer_8|Flying causes a huge amount of CO2 emission. Stay on the ground whenever you can. If you like to travel, taking the train is a great, fun option!
climate_crisis_explainer_9|Be Informed
climate_crisis_explainer_10|Knowledge is power! Read climate news and facts on sites like The Guardian Environment and the Climate Reality Project.

FreePlay.FreePlayStart.text|Welcome to this Free Play Scenario!\nA few citizens are already here. Some more will arrive over the coming days.
FreePlay.FreePlayStart.planning.afterDoneMessage|All the people from your ship have now arrived. Of course, your population can still grow through their offspring.

theLostShip.json/Start.text|It's 2142, and earth is a wasteland. Colonizing this tiny world is humanity's only hope.\n\nFirst, you'll need some more building materials. Let's build a woodcutting center.
theLostShip.json/Start.quickText|Build a woodcutting center.
theLostShip.json/BuildStoneMine.text|Good job! Now, collect some wood and build a stone mine.
theLostShip.json/BuildStoneMine.quickText|Build a stone mine.
theLostShip.json/GatherWoodAndStone.text|Well done! Right now, nobody is going to gather stone, as everybody already has a job at the woodcutting center. Let's reassign one of these workers.
theLostShip.json/GatherWoodAndStone.quickText|Gather 6 wood and 4 stone. You'll need to reassign some workers.
theLostShip.json/BuildIndoorFarmAndHouse.text|You used a space ship to get here. Some of your friends are still on it. You'll want to give them a place to live. A steady food supply would be nice, too.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, let's build a house and an indoor farm.[nonmobi] Please note that buildings can be stacked.
theLostShip.json/BuildIndoorFarmAndHouse.quickText|Build a house and an indoor farm.
theLostShip.json/SpawnMorePeople.text|Good job! Some more people will arrive soon.\nIt could be helpful to learn some more about this world. In particular, the alien ruins look quite interesting. Let's build an exploration center to learn all about them and maybe get some useful resources too.
theLostShip.json/SpawnMorePeople.quickText|Build an exploration center.
theLostShip.json/NowArrivingRegularly.text|New people will now start arriving regularly. Make sure to keep them fed and housed. Also, children can be born from now on. You can build a school for them if you want.[n]\nTo build up your city, you'll need lots of stone, so let's build one more stone mine.
theLostShip.json/NowArrivingRegularly.quickText|Build a second stone mine.
theLostShip.json/StoneMineUpgrade.text|[c]Your stone miners have good equipment thanks to the Better Pickaxes upgrade. Great job![/][n]Your stone miners are currently working with low-quality mining equipment. Better pickaxes would improve their mining speed. Upgrade at least one of your stone mines. To do so, [nonmobi]click[mobi]tap[/] on the stone mine, then on the Better Pickaxes upgrade.
theLostShip.json/StoneMineUpgrade.quickText|Upgrade a stone mine with better pickaxes.
theLostShip.json/Happiness.text|Now that you've got a pretty good economy, it's time to focus on your citizens' wellbeing for a bit. Not that there's no economic advantage to that at all, as happy citizens work faster. To make them more happy, let's build a pub. Also, make sure you have at least 10 food.
theLostShip.json/Happiness.quickText|Build a pub and have at least 10 food.
theLostShip.json/BuildMachinePartsFactory.text|Great job! Make sure there's actually someone working at the pub or it won't have any effect.\nThe city will need machines.

theLostShip.json/BuildMachinePartsFactory.quickText|Build a machine parts factory.
theLostShip.json/GetMinHappiness.text|The machine parts factory uses lots of stone, so make sure you have enough! If you need stone for something else, just switch it off for a while.[n]\nIt's always nice to see happy faces, isn't it? Let's make sure the happiness in your city is at least 52. Just [nnonmobi]click[nmobi]tap[n] on the Happiness button if you'd like to see which areas could use improvement.[/n]
theLostShip.json/GetMinHappiness.quickText|Bring the happiness in your city above 52.
theLostShip.json/BuildStoneTeleporter.text|The amount of stone on this planet is quite limited. Fortunately, you've just thought of a way to solve that problem: a rock teleporter could teleport mineable rocks from elsewhere. Let's research and build one. You may want to build some labs to get more knowledge.
theLostShip.json/BuildStoneTeleporter.quickText|Build a rock teleporter.
theLostShip.json/BuildObservatory.text|Well done! You'll never run out of stone now. Keep your stone mines, as you need those workers to mine the meteroids.\nYour population is growing quickly, and this world is quite small. It's probably a good idea to look for other worlds to colonize, so let's build an observatory.
theLostShip.json/BuildObservatory.quickText|Build the observatory.
theLostShip.json/Win.title|Scenario Complete!
theLostShip.json/Win.text|Great job! Your scientists will now look for other worlds to colonize. You can play the next scenario to see what they'll find.\nIf you'd like to continue improving this city, you can always go to the next scenario later from the menu. Either way, you can always return to this city later.

multipleWorlds.json/Start.text|Soon after building the observatory, your scientists found a world that looked promising. You decided to fly there and take a look. Apparently, your scientists didn't look very closely, because what they thought to be one world are actually multiple tiny worlds. Still, this looks like a fairly suitable location to build a city.\nTo get started, let's build a woodcutting center, a stone mine, an indoor farm and a house.
multipleWorlds.json/Start.quickText|Build a woodcutting center, a stone mine, an indoor farm and a house.
multipleWorlds.json/MorePeople.text|That's a good start! You've invited some people from your previous city. They'll arrive in the coming days.\nYour citizens don't seem very happy right now. Let's build a pub to cheer them up a bit.
multipleWorlds.json/MorePeople.quickText|Build a pub.
multipleWorlds.json/GoBuildMPF.text|The pub should make your citizens a bit less sad! To get to the other worlds, you'll need machine parts, so let's create a machine parts factory.
multipleWorlds.json/GoBuildMPF.quickText|Build a machine parts factory.
multipleWorlds.json/MachinePartsFactoryBuilt.text|The machine parts factory is very useful, but currently not very efficient. Let's upgrade it to recycle scrap metal. This will reduce the amount of stone it uses.
multipleWorlds.json/MachinePartsFactoryBuilt.quickText|Upgrade your machine parts factory to make it recycle scrap metal.
multipleWorlds.json/GoToOtherWorlds.text|[c]You already built some landing pads to connect worlds. Great job![/][n]Good job! Now, it's finally time to get to another world. The easiest way to do that is by building landing pads. Let's build two of them: one on your current world and one on another world you'd like to populate.[/]
multipleWorlds.json/GoToOtherWorlds.quickText|Connect the currently populated world with another by building landing pads.
multipleWorlds.json/GoToOtherWorldsDone.text|[c]You already built an experimental farm! Well done![/][n]Now that your city has some more space, it'll probably grow rapidly. You'll soon have many more mouths to feed. To make that a bit easier, let's build an experimental farm.[/]
multipleWorlds.json/GoToOtherWorldsDone.quickText|Build an experimental farm.
multipleWorlds.json/GoBuildRefinedMetalFactory.text|[c]You already built a refined metals factory! Good job![/][n]To build some types of buildings, raw stone isn't good enough. You'll need to refine it first. Let's build a refined metals factory to do just that.[/]
multipleWorlds.json/GoBuildRefinedMetalFactory.quickText|Build a refined metals factory.
multipleWorlds.json/GetHighHappiness.text|[c]Wow, I'm impressed! You already got the happiness high enough to beat this goal.[/][n]Refined metals are nice, but happy citizens are certainly even nicer. So let's use some of these refined metals to improve the happiness of your citizens. Bring it to at least 80.[/]
multipleWorlds.json/GetHighHappiness.quickText|Bring the happiness above 80.
multipleWorlds.json/Win.title|Scenario Complete!
multipleWorlds.json/Win.text|Your citizens are really happy now, and they wouldn't want to live anywhere else. Great job!\n\nYou can now play the next scenario, or continue improving your city if you'd like. Thanks for playing!

hackersandaliens.json/Start.text|Humanity is slowly colonizing space. This is the newest outpost. It is still quite small, but new people are arriving quickly.\nYou don't want them to be homeless, of course. To prevent this, build houses until you have at least fifty capacity.

hackersandaliens.json/InTheMeantime3.text|The worker in the research spacecraft noticed a strange power prevented them from getting close to the glowing worlds. This also means you can't build on them. Maybe the alien ruins can help?
hackersandaliens.json/InTheMeantime3.quickText|Explore the alien ruins on this world.
hackersandaliens.json/BuildRefinedMetalsFactory.text|While investigating the alien ruins, your explorers found a small device. You think it could have something to do with the inaccessible worlds.\nHowever, none of your citizens has been able to make sense of it. Maybe having some computers would help? To build them, you will first need some refined metals. Build a Refined Metals Factory to produce those.
hackersandaliens.json/BuildRefinedMetalsFactory.quickText|Build a Refined Metals Factory.
